## design
in terms of ui/ux, i tried my best to copy the design from provided figma file. downloaded svg's as necessary. furthermore, the app was designed with modularity, so the use of components was vital.
## what went well
i have lots of experience with react, so developing the frontend of the website was fairly easy
## challenges
had a little struggle using the rest api
## improvements
could implement caching for api requests to optimize app
